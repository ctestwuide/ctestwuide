👋 Hi, I'm Chase Testwuide (@ctestwuide), a recent graduate seeking IOS Developer roles!

🎓 My academic journey uniquely intertwines business and technology. I embarked on my career with an undergraduate focus in Accounting and Marketing. However, my curiosity and the dynamic allure of technology led me to pivot during my graduate studies at Cornell University, where I pursued Financial Management and Accounting. Simultaneously, I was captivated by the potential of software development, prompting me to enroll in an MSc in Software Development at the University of Glasgow, Scotland. In December 2023, I proudly completed both degrees, marking a significant milestone in my educational journey.

📍 Currently residing in Boston, I am on the lookout for opportunities within the tech industry that allow me to blend my foundational knowledge in business with my passion for technology. While my initial hands-on experience gravitated towards web technologies—including React.js, Django, Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL—I am now eagerly venturing into the realm of iOS Development.

📱 As I near the completion of Codecademy's iOS Developer certificate course, my goal is to specialize further in this exciting subsector. My educational background and hands-on experience have equipped me with a solid foundation in both web and iOS development, making me a versatile and adaptive candidate ready to contribute to innovative projects.

🚀 I'm open to exploring opportunities with startups and larger companies alike, particularly those offering remote roles that align with my new focus on iOS Development. My journey through business and technology has instilled in me a holistic approach to problem-solving, a zeal for continuous learning, and a collaborative spirit aimed at leveraging technology to forge innovative solutions.

Whether it's a job opportunity, a collaborative project, or just a chance to exchange ideas, I'm keen on exploring new challenges and expanding my portfolio in the tech landscape.

Let's collaborate and build something amazing together! 🚀
